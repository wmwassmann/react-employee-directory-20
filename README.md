# Personal Goal

To dig deep and create a React App, a technology I genuinely really like and made me fall in love with coding, and be proud of it as a homework submission. 

Through this app, I will prove to myself that I'm a good coder who understands this material better than I think I do. 

- Build confidence for the work place
- Prove myself to myself
- Use a technology that I get excited about properly. 

# Installation

To install: 
- Clone the repository
- Run the command "npm install" from the hw-Character-20 folder 
- Run the command "npm start" from the hw-Character-20 folder 
- This Character directory will be hosted locally in localhost:3000, or you can view it via (heroku)


# Usage
- To view Character cards with their name, and contact information as well as their job description, and filter based on name, location, and title parameters.

# Future 

- initially I was going to keep this as an Character roster/directory, and then after submitting keep adding to it.  But currently I am working on a Dungeons and Dragons application, and may start shifting this technology into a "saved character" selector of sorts.  It seems very useful for our project. 
- Future features will include
  - The ability to create and remove character
  - Storing into a MySQL database rather than a db.json (which is nice for) prebuilt entries. 
  - Fixing the images.
